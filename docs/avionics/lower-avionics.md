## Pressure Transducers

The [LPPT25-20-1000H](https://www.automationdirect.com/adc/shopping/catalog/process_control_-a-_measurement/pressure_sensors/pressure_transmitters/lppt25-20-1000h) was chosen. It has a slightly higher tolerance at 1% compared to some others, but it is considerably cheaper. It's current output not voltage output which means better reliability. We will need a high tolerance resistor to put in series, and potentially a current sensor.
