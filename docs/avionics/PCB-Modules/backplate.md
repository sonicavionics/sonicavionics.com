# [Backplate](https://github.com/sonicavionics/4in-backplate)

---

The backplate is extremely simple. It has 140 through hole pins and two SMD which which we solder manually. Two of the pins on the PCIe socket are removed to make way for the CAN bus. This is the only board that is not assembled by JLCPCB.
