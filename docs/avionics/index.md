# Dingboard

Maybe I should rename this before it's too late. Actually it's already too late.

## Initial Requirements and Design Goals

The primary goal of dingboard is to enable my personal learning.
This will be the first board of many. The successor to dingboard will be a CAN enabled system in a 4-inch diameter form factor which will hopefully be launched this summer.

Primary Functional Requirements for dingboard:

- Easy to operate and understand
- Don't be janky
- Fully open source
- Assemblable by JLCPCB PCBA
- Utilize all known best practices to enable scalability

[Here's the link](https://github.com/zeulewan/dingboard) to the project repo with the Solidworks and Altium files.

## Checklist (for power 0.0.2)

- [x] Altium with GitHub
- [x] Begin PCB V1
- [x] Complete board schematic
- [x] solid works and altium
  - [ ] ~~set board dimensions~~ Gonna set the board dimensions after I get the first iteration of the power board ordered
- [x] get proper PCIe dimensions
- [ ] ~~add power switch for battery~~ Forget it i'll just unplug it for this version
- [x] finish routing
  - [x] buck boost
  - [x] fuel gauge
- [ ] ~~add test points~~ there are enough exposed connections i can poke at
- [X] add all LCSC designators
- [x] double check all connections
- [x] order from JLC

## Library

I started using the [Celestial Altium Library](https://altiumlibrary.com/).
[Install video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBvwvbw83iY)

I finally found a [PCIe x1 footprint](https://www.snapeda.com/parts/PCIE-036-02-S-D-EMS3/Samtec%20Inc./view-part/). edit: should have just made it from scratch. That footprint was garbage, had to redo it.

## Open source

The student rocketry community is quite open to sharing ideas. This makes it easier for new student teams such as my own to build themselves up. The goal is to have a thriving space industry. The bottom line is that the more people we have that are knowledgeable in rocketry the better chance humanity has. This is largely the philosophy the rocketry teams I've spoken to have. This is one reason why MARS strives to open source everything we do. We stand on the shoulders of giants. It is unfeasible to donate to every single open source project you gain knowledge from, so the least we can do is to contribute back the the community by open sourcing everything we do. We have everything to gain from the success of others. Open source doesn't mean copying others stuff, and being a free loader. We strive to learn from and contribute to each step of the process.

### Inspiration

I've been inspired by rocketry teams such as [Waterloo](https://www.waterloorocketry.com/), [Queens](https://qret.ca/), [Etes](https://rockets.etsmtl.ca/), and [Oronos](https://oronospolytechnique.com/en.html). Waterloo is extremely helpful due to all of their documentation being public on their website. I've visited Queens a few times and they are always okay with sharing info. Without these two teams, MARS' success would be a lot harder.

#### CAN bus

Every team settles on CAN bus. I have no experience with it, but I will be implementing it on dingboard.

#### Modularity with PCIe connectors

The modular system I first noticed at LC 2023. Etes showed me their system. I noticed Queens also did it, then I noticed Oronos did it. It seems like an obvious place to start, I mean it makes things really easy and elegant. The downside is that its not as structurally robust as Waterloos RocketCAN system.

## Battery

For the SRAD board we will be using a SRAD battery back and the opposite is true for the COTS stuff. For the first launch it will be a 2s 2p pack inspired by [this video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dD5KmM8ciU)
