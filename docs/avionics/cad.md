There's just barely enough space to fit the RFD900 on a module. so why not?
The challenge is to see if these over hangs can print.

[Here](/blog/2024/12/07/avionics-bay-cad/) is a blog post showing some other revisions.

## Rack

The rack will use [these threaded inserts](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B0CNRSJ1B2?psc=1)

### 3D printing

The rack had to be printed at a 45 degree angle.
