Friday I ordered the GPS module using the ublox NEO-M9N through JLCPCB PCB Assembly.

It’s now completed assembly and heading from the workshop to the warehouse. Total cost was `$118.10 USD` ($161.61 CAD including shipping).
Ran into an issue early on, the GPS module was already out of stock before ordering, so I had to place a pre-order. Unfortunately, the original pre-order supplier also ran out of stock right as the board design was finished. JLCPCB support found an alternative channel to source the modules. Took some emails back and forth, but everything is finally on track now. The module has passed final assembly inspection and is now moving from the workshop to the warehouse for shipping.

## Next up: 

Testing u-center setting up the modules for integration into the avionics system. Making steady progress!
