It only took 7 days for the boards to arrive this time!

## Lessons

### Sensor Module

For a reason I still don't quite understand, the only cables that have been working for the data transmission are USB-C to USB-A. The USB-C to UCB-C cables don't. I though it had something to do with USB 2 vs 3 but I've tried a both 2 and 3 and they work.

Test points, silk screen labels and an LED or two on the next version. Not necessary, the board works fine right now but it's important for troubleshooting.

### PowerSim

Only some power supplies work. Macbook port doesn't unless there's I use an adapter thing, and my 40W Anker wall adapter doesn't either, Alienware ports do work. The reason for this is due to protection circuits present on some power supplies. 

The idea is they don't want a live wire lying around because it acts like an inductor and could potentially have high transient current. So if you have a very very small load, it will just shut off the power to the port to prevent that. 

### Backplate

I used 0805 resistors. I could have made them even bigger. Soldering all the PCIe pins is more annoying than it looks. I wish JLC assembled that.

## Next Steps

I'll be testing out CAN bus soon. I have 4 sensor boards to test with. (I broke one during testing) If all goes well I'll start work on the power module.

The CAD and 3D printing for the enclosure needs to be finalized as well.
