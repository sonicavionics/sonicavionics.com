I've set up a GitHub actions shared workflow to automatically render schematics, footprint editor and 3D PCB images. All the pictures you see on the blog are automatically generated, and updated every time a commit is made.

I used these resources:

- [Rendering KiCAD PCB to PNG](https://www.medo64.com/2024/06/rendering-kicad-pcb-to-png/)
- [model-viewer](https://modelviewer.dev/)
- [Introduction to the KiCad Command-Line Interface](https://docs.kicad.org/8.0/en/cli/cli.html#introduction_to_the_kicad_command_line_interface)
