Things I bought today:

- Test PCBs from JLC, module and backplate for the dingboard
- 12 18650s
- spot welder and threaded heat inserts
- PCIe and UCB-C receptacles

Should I use 0603, 0402 or 0201?
If I go with 0603 we can solder it pretty easily. 0201 its not happening, and 0402 it's harder. Those components aren't even the expensive ones to have JLCPCB assemble for you. Actually 0201 is more expensive I think. Okay 0402 it is then. 

For the next board, we'll have a way to upload new code over the air. The CAN network will have its bootselect pins on the PCIe bus, the raspberry pi 5 or something will be able to put any of them into mass storage mode, and upload new code on the USB lines... maybe I should just do this now. okay fine i'll do it now
