The site has officially been changed to Sonic Avionics. I choose this name because sonicavionics.com was available and it kinda rhymes. I changed dingboard's name to 4" Avionics. This is kind of sad, but we're gonna have to present to some committees and it wouldn't look good to have it called that. We lack credibility so a silly name would be seen as a negative thing. I promise to make the 6 inch avionics called dongboard.
