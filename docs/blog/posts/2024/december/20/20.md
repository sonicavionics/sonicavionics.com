The power module 0.0.2 works perfectly.

Here's some photos of me testing it. I got heat shrink that's too big.

I even got the fuel gauge chip working.

A month into this project, and I got a working PCB! I'm happy about that. Not often it works on the first try either. It took 15 days for the PCBs to arrive and it cost $116.28 CAD for assembly for 5 boards including shipping and tax and everything.
