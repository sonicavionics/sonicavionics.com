.lia files are fully broken in Altium. You literally just can't import them anymore.

There's this nice [PCIe template](https://circuitmaker.com/Projects/Details/Patrick-Reeb-2/PCIE-x1-Template) I want to use, but circuit maker is effed.
Why are they even trying to keep circuit maker alive? It's fully broken because it wants you to sign in with a name and password but you can only use google to sign up in the browser and there's no option to change your password anywhere. 

There used to be a [template libary?](https://techdocs.altium.com/display/ALIVE/AltiumLive+-+Content+Store). Now all the "design content" links redirect to octopart which doesn't seem to have templates like the design content.

The license manager has to be one of the most annoying things known to man. Every now and then you start up Altium and you have to click "release" then roam on three licenses because it thinks you're signed in somewhere else.

Altium, Solidworks and Onshape have different methods of rotation. 

Onshape is clearly the best, pan zoom and rotate are all done without a modifier. It's just constrained rotate which uses shift. I don't think solidworks even has that though.

Altium is the worst is uses track ball rotation which inherently requires more clicks.
