Agenda:

- [x] solid works and altium
    - [ ] ~~set board dimensions~~ Gonna set the board dimensions after I get the first iteration of the power board ordered
- [x] get proper PCIe dimensions
- [ ] ~~add power switch for battery~~ forget it i'll just unplug it for this version
- [ ] finish routing
- [ ] add test points
- [ ] add all LCSC designators

This is not going to be a CAN enabled board. The gold fingers are for practice, and modularity. The only reason it's not the next board already is because I choose 1S for the battery for simplicity. Might have been better to just make the full board from the get go. but since I'll have to go to 3S I should just to the CAN stuff when I do that.

if time:

- add table of contents to menu if it doesn't work make open an issue
- make tables have divisions
