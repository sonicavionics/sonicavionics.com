Considering ordering the power board on its own for now. The only issue is the wait time. Could continue with 6502 stuff until then or work on the CPU board. 

Here's the current check list of things to implement:


1. :octicons-check-circle-24: Battery protection IC
2. :octicons-check-circle-24: Charging IC
3. :octicons-check-circle-24: Buck-boost
