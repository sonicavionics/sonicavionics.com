So to use ECAD/MCAD you have to use Altium 365. It makes it's own .git file in the main Altium directory. So you could still have a .git in the directory above it which you could push to github as a primary thing. Then you could just push to the Altium 365 whenever you want to use MCAD. The ECAD/MCAD integration just doesn't seem worth the hassle though. Being able to move around components in MCAD does seem really cool though. I just wish they did it right. Engineering tools are never designed by good software engineers. The software engineers that make it never really use it. The best stuff is made by the people that use the thing. git is so good because the people that maintain it are the people that use it. I love that shit that's like "made by blank for blank." Usually it's shampoo or something, but when it's actually true the product is good.

When I pushed my project to Altium 365 it copied my project to a new location on my computer. So I've been making all these changes to a separate repo this whole time. So to continue using the old repo, I'd have to delete the old files and add the new files, reinitializing the repo basically. Because the Altium files are all binaries. I hate Altium.


At some point I switched the buck boost to a linear regulator/boost. Idk how that happened now I gotta switch it back.
