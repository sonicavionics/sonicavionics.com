# About

## Open Source Philosophy

The student rocketry community is quite open to sharing ideas. This makes it easier for new student teams such as my own to build themselves up. The goal is to have a thriving space industry. The bottom line is that the more people we have that are knowledgeable in rocketry the better chance humanity has. This is largely the philosophy the rocketry teams I've spoken to have. 

We stand on the shoulders of giants. It is unfeasible to donate to every single open source project you gain knowledge from, so the least we can do is to contribute back the the community by open sourcing everything we do. We have everything to gain from the success of others. Open source doesn't mean copying others stuff, and being a free loader. We strive to learn from and contribute to each step of the process.


### Inspiration

This project draws inspiration from rocketry teams such as:

- [Waterloo Rocketry](https://www.waterloorocketry.com/)
- [Queens Rocket Engineering Team](https://qret.ca/)
- [ÉTS Rocketry](https://rockets.etsmtl.ca/)
- [Oronos Polytechnique](https://oronospolytechnique.com/en.html)

Queens and Waterloo have especially been helpful.

Without these teams, Sonic Avionics' progress would have been significantly harder.

### Modularity with PCIe Connectors

The modular avionics system is inspired by designs showcased at LC 2023 by ÉTS. This approach is also used by Queens and Oronos, making it a natural starting point. While it simplifies design and enhances elegance, it is less structurally robust compared to Waterloo’s RocketCAN system.
